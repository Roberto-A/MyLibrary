# MyLibrary

MyLibrary is a book note-taking app. Use it to summarize whole books, or individual chapters. Track characters, or just jot down some notes.

This web app is largely based on [Mozilla's](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) [Express Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs). More specifically the [Local Library website tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website). I am following along but also modifying some aspects to better fit my needs.

The two main modifications are:
1. My app cannot be used to keep track of multiple instances of a book.
2. My app keeps track of book chapters.
